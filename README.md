# 2-5DMap-Dataset

This repository provides a large scale ground-to-2.5D map geolocalization dataset including:
- Ground-view panoramic images collected from [StreetLearn](https://sites.google.com/view/streetlearn/dataset "StreetLearn Dataset") dataset. 
- 2D maps generated by our previous work [You Are Here: Geolocation by Embedding Maps and Images](https://github.com/ZhouMengjie/Image-Map-Embeddings "You Are Here: Geolocation by Embedding Maps and Images").
- 2.5D maps generated by the following data processing pipeline.
